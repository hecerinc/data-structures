# C++ Data Structures

These are my implementations of some common data structures in C++ based on Nell Dale's C++ Data Structures book 3rd Edition.


All of these are implemented as linked structures and as templates to be used with any type of data.

The API that they offer is very simple:

- Empty constructor
- Destructor
- RetrieveItem
- `insert` (or `push` or `enqueue`)
- `remove` (or `pop` or `dequeue`)
- `length` property
- `isEmpty` observer

### Linked List

- `reverse` method

## TODO

- Circular List
- Circular Queue
- Doubly linked list
